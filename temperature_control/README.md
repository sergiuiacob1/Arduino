Temperature Control

This is a personal project. I have a thermostat and I wanted to be able to control it via the Internet.
My solution is an Arduino project that presses the buttons on the thermostat using a Servo SG90.
The code was wrote so it is highly adaptable in case somebody wishes to do a similar thing.
